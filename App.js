// If you have specific JavaScript functionality to add to your video player
// you can do so here. This is a basic file that might include event listeners
// or other interactions for your video player.

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const videoPlayer = document.getElementById('videoPlayer');

  // Add any event listeners or custom controls as needed
  // For example, a listener for when the video ends:
  videoPlayer.addEventListener('ended', () => {
      alert('Video has ended.');
  }); 
});
